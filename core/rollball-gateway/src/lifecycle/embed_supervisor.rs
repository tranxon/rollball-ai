//! Embed process supervisor — monitors the embed child process via SSE,
//! detects failures, and restarts with exponential backoff.
//!
//! ## Why SSE instead of polling
//!
//! Earlier the gateway polled `GET /health` for the embed's loaded model.
//! That had two problems: a 2-second poll lag for state changes, and
//! nothing distinguished "process alive but no model yet" from "process
//! stuck". With the embed's `/events` SSE stream we get push-style state
//! transitions AND a 2-second heartbeat in one connection.
//!
//! ## Failure detection
//!
//! Two layers:
//!   1. `child.wait()` returning — process crashed or was killed.
//!   2. No heartbeat received for `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` (10s) — process
//!      alive but stuck in a deadlock / GC pause / ONNX hang.
//!
//! Both trigger the same restart path.
//!
//! ## Restart policy
//!
//! Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, ... capped at 60s. After
//! `MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS` consecutive failures within
//! `RESTART_WINDOW` (5 minutes) the supervisor gives up and surfaces
//! the failure to the gateway, which falls back to remote embedding
//! providers.
