//! Event bus for the embed runtime.
//!
//! Publishes state transitions (model load/unload, download progress, errors)
//! and periodic heartbeats over a `tokio::sync::broadcast` channel. The
//! `/events` SSE endpoint subscribes to this bus and re-emits events to
//! connected gateway clients.
//!
//! Two event kinds share the same channel:
//!   - `Event::State` — published whenever embed's high-level state changes
//!   - `Event::Heartbeat` — published every 2s by the heartbeat task
//!
//! SSE consumers (gateway) treat missing heartbeats as the "process stuck"
//! signal. State events let the gateway learn the currently loaded model
//! without polling.
