//! Memory session handle — shared state between agent loop and memory tools.
//!
//! Memory tools (memory_recall, memory_store) are created once per agent,
//! but sessions change dynamically and the Grafeo store may be initialized
//! lazily (after tool creation). This handle provides a shared, lock-protected
//! context for session-scoped operations without changing the Tool trait.

/// and memory tools (readers).
///
/// # Design
///
/// - `store`: lazily initialized; tools check availability on each call.
/// - `current_session_id`: written by `SessionTask` before each turn,
///   read by tools during `execute()`.  Uses `RwLock` because writes are
///   infrequent (once per turn switch) and reads far more common.
/// - `embedding_provider`: set once at construction, immutable thereafter.
///   Tools and agent loop pass it to [`MemoryManager::retrieve`] for
///   auto-embedding.
///
/// This separation avoids the need to inject session context through the
/// [`Tool`](acowork_core::tools::traits::Tool) trait, keeping tool
/// signatures simple while still providing session-aware behaviour.
