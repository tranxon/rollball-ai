//! Inbound message handling for the AgentLoop.
//!
//! Extracted from loop_.rs (ADR-014 Phase 3).
//! Contains all methods related to processing inbound messages:
//! - `apply_user_op`: central dispatch for UserOp variants
//! - `poll_stop`: non-blocking stop-signal check with message buffering
//! - `drain_inbound_queue`: full inbound queue drain with message injection
//!
//! D1 Deduplication: the message-into-history injection logic appeared 3 times
//! (deferred UserMessage/SystemNotification/IntentMessage, live ditto, and
//! run_inner iteration-limit pause). The `inject_inbound_into_history()` helper
//! consolidates these into a single implementation.
